# Funny-Emoji-Prediction-
Hello :)
Emojis are the  fun way of expressing oneself. So, our sydtems should also be aware of the appropriate emoji to be used at the right time. This project does the same. In this project, I build a classifier that is predicting emoji's according to a given sentence using Stacked LSTM (RNN) Deep Learning Models.
In this project, I have used the 6B 50D glove vector to build embedding matrix of words available in the glove vector.
Download the 6B.50.50d.txt file and extract the file in the same directory as that of the code.
